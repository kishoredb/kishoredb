# **Hi, I'm Kishore D. B.**  
## **Applied AI • Scientific Machine Learning • Computational Systems Engineering**

I am an independent researcher and engineering leader working at the intersection of **scientific ML**, **computational modeling**, and **cloud-native AI infrastructure**.

My work focuses on designing **reproducible, scalable, research-grade computational systems** that support simulation workflows, ML pipelines, and data-driven decision systems across domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific computing.

I combine industry-scale engineering with research-oriented methods, emphasizing **model explainability**, **numerical reliability**, and **transparent computational workflows** compatible with academic standards.
