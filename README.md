<img src="./assets/Handwave.JPG" width="24" /> Hi, I'm Kishore D. B.
Applied AI • Scientific Machine Learning • Computational Systems Engineering

I am an independent researcher and engineering leader working at the intersection of scientific ML, computational modeling, and cloud-native AI infrastructure.
My work focuses on designing reproducible, scalable, research-grade computational systems that support simulation workflows, ML pipelines, and data-driven decision systems across domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific computing.

I combine industry-scale engineering with research-oriented methods, emphasizing model explainability, numerical reliability, and transparent computational workflows compatible with academic standards.
